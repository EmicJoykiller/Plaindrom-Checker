This project is a user-friendly web application designed to check whether a given word or sentence is a palindrome. The interface features a clean and modern design with a dark-themed layout. Users can input any text, and upon clicking the "Check" button, the application processes the input by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting the text to lowercase. It then checks if the text reads the same forward and backward. The result is displayed immediately, indicating whether the input is a palindrome. This project demonstrates the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic, providing an excellent example of basic web development principles in action.
